So far, I have implemented the following functions

=== Basic Statistic ===

double mean(double *a, unsigned int n)
double mean2(double *a, unsigned int n)
double variance(double *a, unsigned int n)
double variance_safe(double *a, unsigned int n)
double covariance(double *a, double *b, unsigned int n)
double covariance_safe(double *a, double *b, unsigned int n)
