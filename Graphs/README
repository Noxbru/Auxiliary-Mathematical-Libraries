 The graphs are structures with this shape:
A pointer to an array of nodes and a pointer to
an array of edges, and the total number of nodes
and edges

struct graph
{
    struct node *nodes;
    struct edge *edges;
    unsigned int n_nodes, n_edges;
};

So far, we have implemented the followinf functions:

=== Functions to create graphs ===

struct graph create_erdos_renyi_graph(unsigned int nods, unsigned int edgs)
struct graph create_barabasi_albert_graph(unsigned int m0, unsigned int times, unsigned int m, unsigned int pref_at)

=== Functions to print graphs ===

void graph_to_dot_file(char *c, struct graph g, char over)
void graph_to_file(char *c, struct graph g, char over)

=== Functions to analize a graph ===

unsigned int max_neighbours(struct graph g)
unsigned int * grade_distribution(struct graph g)
